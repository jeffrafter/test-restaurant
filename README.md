# Build me a restaurant... website

## Installation

Run `npm install`

## Usage

To run the live server, run `npm run serve`

## Task

I am the client. You are the web developer.

I've just commissioned you to build me a website!

Here is the mockup [desktop-mockup.png](desktop-mockup.png)

Now build!

## Rules / Hints

1) Fonts haven't been included. You will have to find fonts that closely approximate the original, but do not have to be exact. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a good place to start

2) There is no mobile design or tablet design, only desktop

3) Image assets can be found in the `/images` directory

Good luck and... don't get hungry looking at all that food!

## Bonus Task

As stated above, there are no mobile or desktop designs. However, you can still write CSS for this.

Using the device simulator in the browser, examine how the website you built responds to a smaller screen. What ways can we present the information on such a small screen?

1) You may want to go for a reduced font-size

2) You may want to layout content differently (so that it is not displayed in a row)

3) You may want to hide certain elements from the mobile view using the `display: none` property

Using the above points as a guideline, try to create mobile and desktop versions of your website.
